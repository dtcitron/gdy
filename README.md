gdy = "Graph Dynamics"

Python package and scripts for performing discrete-time stochastic simulations of the SIRS
(susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible) model of infectious diseases. This package is
ideal for performing these simulations on complex connectivity networks (such as random
poisson or heavy-tailed networks) that represent the connectivity between individuals in
a population susceptible to disease.

This repository contains:
  gdy.py - The Python package, containing everything needed to simulate SIRS-type
           disease models and produce visualizations of the phase diagram
           
  gdy_demo.ipynb - iPython notebook demonstrating the use of the package
